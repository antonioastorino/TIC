# TIC
Since I was a kid, I always dreamt of writing my own Tetris game.

After about 30 years, I suddenly decided that the child I was deserved such a dream to be realized - not on a C64, though.

Speaking of which, TIC works on Mac and Linux.

### Build and run

Run

```
bin/makeMakefile && make && ./tetris-0
```

### Key bindings

- `a` -> move left
- `s` -> move down (once)
- `d` -> move right
- `SPACE BAR` -> move down to the bottom
- `j` -> rotate counterclockwise
- `l` -> rotate clockwise
- `ESCAPE` -> quit
